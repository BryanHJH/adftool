# ADFTool

This is a Final Year Project for APD3F2311CS(CYB). This tool is mainly developed from my own needs when tackling Digital Forensics CTF challenges. The main aim for this tool is to have all the Digital Forensics-related tools in one 'toolbox'. The tool is aimed to be offline/desktop-based, however, due to certain limitations, it will be running at localhost in a browser instead of a standalone desktop application.

## Tools to include

### Steganalysis tools

- [x] zsteg
- [x] stegoveritas
- [x] outguess
- [x] binwalk

### Network Packet analysis tools

- [x] tshark

### Memory analysis

- [ ] Volatility
- [ ] The Sleuth Kit

## User Interface

This tool will include a Graphical User Interface (GUI), mainly to satisfy my FYP requirement. The GUI is to be built using Python Flask.

### TODO

- [ ] Learn Python Flask
- [ ] Design the interface
- [ ] Code it out
